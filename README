Sparklines - an iOS Custom View Implementation
----------------------------------------------

 Sparklines are small, word-sized graphics showing historical values for a
measured data item.They were described by Edward Tufte in his 1982 book "The
Visual Display of Quantitative Information", and are designed to represent
a lot of data in a small space.

 This project is an iOS custom view implementation of sparklines, and is
released under the BSD license. While the custom view consists of two
Objective-C files, the code is provided as a complete iOS Xcode project that
will build and run on Xcode V4.1 or greater (it will probably build and run
under earlier versions but I haven't confirmed that). Both the iPhone/iPod
Touch and the iPad is supported by this demo.

 Please read the embedded documentation in the SparklineView.h file; a
doxygen config file is also provided, so you can build your own HTML
documentation, which includes a graphical explanation of what sparklines
are.

Added two additional properties to ASBSparkLineView:

UIColor *penColor	- 	UIColor for the sparkline
float penWidth		-	the sparkline with in pixels

Note - the draw methods don't adjust for the pen width, so 
large penWidth value are likely to cause clipping of the sparkline
as it intercepts the upper and lower boundaries. Sorry about that :(
